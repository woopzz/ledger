### Todo

- [ ] Make a pre-commit hook (by Husky probably) which runs the build task. Thus we'll have a build with latest changes on github.
- [ ] Tests.
- [ ] Open a modal window with payment details when click on a line.
- [ ] Add a UI frameword. Material? Tailwind?
- [ ] Too small checkboxes. It's very inconvenient to hit them.
